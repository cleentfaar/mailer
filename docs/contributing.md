# Contributing
 
Contributions are very welcome. Please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Use [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) to keep your code style consistent. 
This tool is automatically installed if you run `php composer.phar install` in the root of this project. For more 
information on using PHP-CS-Fixer (and the `.php_cs` configuration in the root of this project), check out it's 
[documentation](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
- Please do not submit a pull request with actual drivers. Instead you should create your own package for it; 
I'd be happy to add your package to the `Related packages`-section in the `README.md`. As a starting template you could 
use my [mailer-swiftmailer](https://github.com/cleentfaar/mailer-swiftmailer) package.
