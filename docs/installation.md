# Installation
 
The recommended way to install Mailer is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
php composer.phar require cleentfaar/mailer
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

You can then later update Mailer using composer:

 ```bash
composer.phar update
 ```
